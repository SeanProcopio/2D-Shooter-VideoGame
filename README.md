This video game was created using a game loop timer, jpanels, a key listener, and graphics. 

CONTROLS: WASD moves the player, ARROWKEYS fires the bullets in the corresponding direction, SPACEBAR gives the player a 3 times speed boost when held down.

Running Instructions: You will need JDK and JRE installed. Download and unzip the entire 2D-Shooter-VideoGame folder. Using command prompt, cd into the location of this folder. Type "javac Main" to compile the code first. Next type "java Main" and the code will execute. I could not include the .exe file for this game because it requried my jre folder to be included to run, and the file size was too large.
